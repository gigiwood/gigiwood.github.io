<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Iowa-Life-Changing-Gigi-Wood/dp/B001650O8Q">This is a 449-page, 28-chapter</a> book I wrote during a 14-month stint for the state of Iowa. During that time, I traveled more than 10,000 miles across Iowa, visited 97 of the 99 counties and interviewed more than 200 people.
