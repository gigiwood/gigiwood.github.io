#Gigi Wood Portfolio Project Proposal

###Overview:
My portfolio website is designed to showcase the programming I’ve learned throughout the class, as well as  a place to store my resume, writing samples and technical tips for site visitors. I hope to include a Media Tips page that will help visitors get their story in the newspaper and how to write a press release. I plan to write a white paper on one of these media topics and post it to the site for sale for $1, in order to incorporate e-commerce capabilities into the site. 

For my resume, I would like to be able to make it available online as a pdf file, which will require markdown language. I may put it in other programming languages, like JSON, since that’s apparently the hot new trend. I would like to take my resume and put it into a storytelling form in CSS, where each job experience is a different CSS slide (or something similar). 

I think I should buy gigiwood.com and put all this stuff on it. So I need to decide whether to use a CMS like WordPress to put it together, or some other, more raw system. 

###Technical Overview:
My portfolio website needs to be created within the next week and a half. I plan to complete all the basics of the site and will likely continue to add to it after the class is complete. 

I will be using CSS for the storytelling and JavaScript and SQL for the storytelling. 

###Deliverables
Completion of this project will allow users to perform the following actions:
<ol>
<li>View my resume in multiple formats.</li>
<li>View examples of my coding experience in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li>
<li>View Media Tips and buy a white paper on getting a story in the paper. </li>
<li>View writing samples of mine.</li>
</ol>

###Scope
For this project the following items are in scope:
<ol>
<li>The user will be able to mark items as completed by checking a relevant checkbox.</li>
<li>The user will be able to mark an already completed item as incomplete by unchecking a relevant checkbox.</li>
<li>The user will be able to mark items as not applicable by checking a relevant box.</li>
<li>Completed items will be shown differently from pending items.</li>
</ol>
The following items are out of scope:
<ul>
<li>I hope to set up the initial components of each of these things, although they might not be totally complete by demo day. </li>
</ul>
###Technology Stack
<ol>
<li>HTML and CSS for basic site setup.</li>
<li>CSS pages for resume storytelling.</li>
